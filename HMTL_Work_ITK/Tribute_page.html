    <p>Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O'Connell is an American singer-songwriter. She first gained public attention in 2015 with her debut single "Ocean Eyes", which was subsequently released by Darkroom, an imprint of Interscope Records. It was written and produced by her brother, Finneas O'Connell, with whom she collaborates on music and live shows. Her commercially successful debut EP Don't Smile at Me (2017) charted in the top 15 in numerous countries, including the US, UK, Canada, and Australia.</p>
    <ul class="font_type"> Facts:
        <li>Eilish and her brother Finneas were homeschooled by Baird, a decision their parents made to spend time with them and give them the freedom to pursue their interests.</li>
        <li> Eilish said her brother and mother inspired her to get into music.</li>
        <li>She wrote her first "real" song at age 11 for her mother's songwriting class. The song is about the zombie apocalypse, inspired by the television series The Walking Dead from which she took script lines and episode titles for the song.</li>
        <li>In 2015, 13-year-old Eilish began working on songs with her brother Finneas, who had been writing and producing for several years and had his own band. The first songs they recorded together were called "She's Broken" and "Fingers Crossed", the former written by Finneas and the latter by Eilish. "We recorded them and put them out on SoundCloud, just for fun," she recalled.</li>
        <li>Eilish possesses a soprano vocal range. Avery Stone of Noisey described her vocals as "ethereal", and Maura Johnston of Rolling Stone characterized them as "whispery".</li>
